## Description

"This website aims to enhance the brand of Mullingar Hiking, which has experienced significant growth in its membership over the past few years. The breathtaking pictures captured during these hikes are truly exceptional. To showcase these remarkable experiences, I have created a gallery page where people can also share their own hiking adventures through the website."

## Technologies Used

In this project, I utilized HTML and CSS. Throughout the process, I sought guidance and inspiration from various outlets. One of my go-to resources was the One Month Podcast, which provided invaluable tips and tricks for mastering these languages. To enhance my understanding of flexbox, I extensively explored W3Schools, experimenting with code and gaining hands-on experience. Additionally, I found great value in watching YouTube videos from channels such as Kevin Powell, LinkedIn Learning, and Dee Mc. For text fonts, I leveraged Google Fonts, while Unsplash served as a reliable source for captivating background and gallery images, sourced specifically from the Mullingar Hiking Group. To help with my grammar and spelling, I used ChatGPT. Lastly, I incorporated Font Awesome for social media icons.

The most difficult part of this project was making the site responsive to smaller screen sizes. I used a few different outlets for ideas, and then I utilized dev tools with the information I had to tweak my project.

Here are some links to videos that helped me.

Making my "Peaks by Province" table section was a challenge. I used a few different outlets to achieve it, including:

CSS Tricks : https://css-tricks.com/under-engineered-responsive-tables/

Ravi Web : How To Create Responsive Table In HTML & CSS || How To Make Responsive Table Using HTML & CSS
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKWtJPumb7g&t=321s

W3 Schools : https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp


After exploring these options and using W3Schools, I would rewrite the code multiple times and also paste it into ChatGPT to finally get the correct syntax.

## Bugs
I encountered a peculiar issue with my homepage not rendering correctly on mobile screens. It would only occupy half of the phone's width. To investigate and troubleshoot the problem, I utilized dev tools and accessed my GitHub pages on my mobile phone. I have attached screenshots to provide a clearer understanding of the issue.

Strangely, this issue occurred sporadically. However, I discovered that if I navigated to my gallery or form page and then returned to the home page, the problem would be resolved, and the homepage would display perfectly. I sought assistance from Code Institute's tutor support, who reported that the page loaded fine on their end without any apparent issues. Additionally, I posted a question on Stack Overflow and discord, where my code was reviewed, but no issues were identified. To eliminate any caching-related concerns, I made sure to clear my cache after every page reload. Despite these efforts, the issue persisted, occurring approximately 50% of the time for me.

Please refer to the attached screenshots for a visual representation of the problem.
