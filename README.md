## Description

This website aims to enhance the brand of Mullingar Hiking, which has experienced significant growth in its membership over the past few years. The breathtaking pictures captured during these hikes are truly exceptional. To showcase these remarkable experiences, I have created a gallery page where people can also share their own hiking adventures through the website

## Technologies Used

In this project, I utilized HTML and CSS. Throughout the process, I sought guidance and inspiration from various outlets. One of my go-to resources was the One Month Podcast, which provided invaluable tips and tricks for mastering these languages. To enhance my understanding of flexbox, I extensively explored W3Schools, experimenting with code and gaining hands-on experience. Additionally, I found great value in watching YouTube videos from channels such as Web Dev Cody, LinkedIn Learning, and Bro Code. For text fonts, I leveraged Google Fonts, while Unsplash served as a reliable source for captivating background and gallery images, sourced specifically from the Mullingar Hiking Group, to help with my grammer and speeling I used Chat GPT Lastly, I incorporated Font Awesome for social media icons.
